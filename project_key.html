	</div>
	<div id= "request">
		<p>In order to use the API, you'll need some authentication credentials.  You can get these by creating an "App" on Yelp, using the App Console <a href = "https://www.yelp.com/developers/v2/manage_api_keys">here</a>.  Enter your website URL, description of how the API will be used, and Industry (ex: "Other", Education") in the fields.

		<p class= "centered">Yelp returns to you the following information:</p>

		<table>
			<thead>
				<th>What it's called</th>
				<th>What it does</th>

			<tr>
				<td>Consumer ID
				<td>User-specific ID (user name) which identifies you to Yelp
			<tr>	
				<td>Consumer Secret
				<td>User-specific password; confirms you are who you say you are to Yelp. Used with the Token Secret to generate a hashed Signature	for secure authentication.
			<tr>
				<td>Access Token ID
				<td>Value used during request authentication to gain access to the Yelp API <a href= "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_API#Endpoints">endpoints.</a>
			<tr>
				<td>Token Secret
				<td>Password associated with the Access Token; confirms the token is being used by the intended party.  Used along with Consumer Secret by OAuth v1 to generate a hashed Signature for secure authentication (see the next page).
